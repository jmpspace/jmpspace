crapships milestone
  each connecting client gets a simple ship at random place
  no snapshot optimization
  actions to physics are connected
  no cleanup

  close the loop starting from client handler

    DONE start from client handler init
    DONE create a random ship and register with ECS
      TODO RANDOM
    DONE create an EntityProcess for snapshot
    DONE client structure deserialization
    DONE client world update from snapshot

    implement actions -> physics
    implement thrust!

    pivot - reimplement thrust
      move all physics into nphysics
        individual mass / total mass / density?
        center of mass
        point thrust

    pivot - smaller MVP
      pre-programmed actions sent to client (same client no changes?)
        loop forever a movie
          reset
          create 4 ships
          each gets a different engine controls
          let simulate for 1000 steps
