While I can't point you to any ready-made examples off the top of my 
head (although I suspect they exist), the general information flow for 
real-time server-based recording of a media stream would be something 
along the lines of: 

 1. Browser retrieves a webpage with javascript in it. 
 2. Browser executes javascript, which: 
     1. Gets a handle to the camera using getUserMedia, 
     2. Creates an RTCPeerConnection 
     3. Calls "createOffer" and "setLocalDescription" on the 
        RTCPeerConnection 
     4. Sends an request to the server containing the offer (in SDP format) 
 3. The server processes the offer SDP and generates its own answer SDP, 
    which it returns to the browser in its response. 
 4. The javascript calls "setRemoteDescription" on the RTCPeerConnection 
    to start the media flowing. 
 5. The server starts receiving DTLS/SRTP packets from the browser, 
    which it then does whatever it wants to, up to and including storing 
    in an easily readable format on a local hard drive. 


Clearly, I've glossed over the details, but I hope that's enough to get 
you in the right direction with a little more research on your end.
